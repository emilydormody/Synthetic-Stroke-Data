# Synthetic-Stroke-Data

Summer research project completed under the supervision of Dr. Terrence Tricco for NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award. This project uses the MIMIC data set, a deindentified data set comprising of hospital data (patient stay times, treatments, medications etc) to create synthetic data related to stroke patients and their treatment pathways. With Python's Mesa library, I created a model that produces synthetic data that closely reflects patterns observed in the MIMIC data. 

Source code is in the basic_model photo, and jupyter notebook files histogram_summaries (contains real analysis and explanations) and results (presents comparisons between real and synthetic data) show a summary of the work done on this project.
